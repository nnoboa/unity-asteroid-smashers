# unity-asteroid-smashers
It's Asteroids with a twist! Rather than shooting asteroids into bits, the goal is to smash into them! As long as your shields remain above 0, you can crash into asteroids without worry. You can restore your shield energy by shooting down alien ships.

Use the arrow keys or WASD to control the ship and space to fire.
